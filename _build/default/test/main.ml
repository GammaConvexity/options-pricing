(* 

   Because we created an options pricing suite, our test cases required 
   extensivity for handling each individual feature both manually and 
   automatically via OUnit. Manual testing was done through our interactive UI 
   where the user has the ability to first select what feature they’d like to use 
   as well as give a program designed inputs (e.g. for black-scholes or the 
   binomial tree model, the user would specify a strike, expiration, underlying 
   price, volatility, and risk-free rate). OUnit testing handled the backend of 
   the testing. For the OPMs (options pricing models), we needed to ensure that 
   the calculations were in line with what a correctly implemented model would 
   price a given option. CSV reader tested cases of reading in different formats, 
   lines, and values of data. Spreads tested possible combinations of different 
   options legs and their correct pricing, in conjunction. Test cases were 
   generated via both glass-box and black-box processes. With glass-box, we tested 
   almost all possible inputs for a given feature to test its bounds and 
   limitations. Black-box testing was implemented as well, as when we tried to 
   integrate features (e.g. how csvreader requires the date object from black-
   scholes) we trusted that the specifications that were written in the mli files 
   were correct from each other and we could integrate adjacent features with 
   ease. Our approach demonstrates the correctness of the system as our testing 
   was required to be extensive. Through our three main approaches—manual testing, 
   glass-box, and black-box—we covered many possible edge cases where the system 
   could possibly break, and ultimately our code passed the tests that we created.

   To further detail testing approaches for individual features:
   
   Our approach to testing the options pricing model was to test our inputs in
   an online calculator and use those values as the expected values.
   Foundational functions like integrate and cdf were tested heavily to ensure
   correct distribution functionality at the tails, which is where the
   distinctions between the different distribution types become apparent.
   Spreads were tested with the online calculator method as well, but the
   precision of such calculators is only down to the penny, so these values are
   evaluated to be equal through a "close enough" comparator function with a
   difference threshold of 1 in 100.
   Random walks are not possible to test, so their tests simply assert true and
   the print statements are commented out. The true test is watching the walk
   with your eyes and determining if the proposition that the events were
   generated by the given distribution is believable.
   We also used online calculators to compute common options pricing such as 
   black-scholes. 

   Almost everything except for our visualization and user input were tested using 
   ounit –– it was much easier to visually see the correct output vs. writing a 
   complicated test –– the same holds for our user input. All of our 
   options pricing models were written using black-box testing because it was 
   easy for us to compare results via online calculators and they were specific. 
   We did not use randomized testing but in the future we could use the normal 
   distribution we made as well as third party to compare. 

   Overall by using the online calculator for options pricing, our own 
  intiution and knowlege of options and doing calculations, we feel pretty 
  confident that our models are accurate –– however, given that many 
  models operate differently it is very hard to compare. We also beleive
  that since have computed all aspect of our pricing model -- mostly importantly 
  our distributions we are confident our math package is working as intended.
