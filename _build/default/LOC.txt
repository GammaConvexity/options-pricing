Our code base is a total of 2197 lines. The code is approximately split into two halves: operational code and test cases. These test cases cover many different edge cases for each feature that was implemented including but not limited to black-scholes, binomial tree, spread, backtest, random walk, csvreader. For csvreader in particular, we agreed that it was best to very extensively test the various possible inputs of data. Our project is an options pricing suite, mainly meant to be used by someone working on an options trading desk. A single error in data processing or handling could spell disaster for an entire firm, causing hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. A prime example of this is Knight Capital Group, who in August of 2012, lost $400 million dollars in 45 minutes due to a few lines of erroneous code, causing their trading algorithms to make orders far beyond their capital capcity. The extensiveness that we tested csvreader would be absolutely necessary in any true industry application.
